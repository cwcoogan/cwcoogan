Hi, I'm Chase! ðŸ¤“ I'm a Masters Student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science.
<br><br>
Most of my projects are in an org, I suggest looking there. The ones I had the most fun building are:<br><br>
[Bellcrve](https://github.com/Bellcrve) -- WINNER Yale Hacks 2024 - a Distributed Monte Carlo Simulation for stock options pricing for market makers.<br>
[NexusAPI](https://github.com/TheNexusAPI) -- WINNER HackHarvard 2023 - a unified API service for researchs and developers to speed up their API query times.<br>
[Tunedown](https://github.com/tunedown) -- a customize song generator based on user biometrics from wearable api data and spotify api data.<br><br>
and... so many more.<br><br>
