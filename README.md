Hi, I'm Chase! ðŸ¤  I'm a Masters Student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science.
<br><br> 
Most of my projects are in an org, so feel free to look there. The ones I had the most fun building are:<br><br>
[Bellcrve](https://github.com/Bellcrve) -- <b>WINNER</b> Yale Hacks 2024 - A Monte Carlo Simulator that calculates stock option pricing and distributes over 20,000 simulations across 10 virtual machines highlighting the distributed environment for market makers. All math done from scratch and package in a [pypi](https://pypi.org/manage/project/mc-option-simulator-yale/releases/).<br><br>
[NexusAPI](https://github.com/TheNexusAPI) -- <b>WINNER</b> HackHarvard 2023 - a unified API service for researchs and developers to speed up their API query times.<br><br>
[ChaosNet](https://github.com/chaosnett) -- A global trade simulator that uses the Partial Equilibrium model paired with Knowledge Graphs to explore the relationship between countries as we simulate and change trade policies. All math and knowldege graphs derived from scratch.<br><br>
[NCxLib](https://github.com/ncxlib/NeuralNetwork) -- a Neural Network library built from scratch in Python. [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ncxlib/) <br><br>
